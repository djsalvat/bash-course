I am the King.

My name is Mr. King. My father was a king, as was his father. I used to be a prince.
Here are the things I like:
-- Bears
-- tears
-- fears
-- Ears
-- pears
-- sears. yes the company.
-- peanuts
-- ears
-- shears
-- NOT brazil nuts
-- walnuts
-- strears. whatever those are.
-- Almond joys

Make no mistake -- mounds are inferior. I hereby declare:
Mounds are to be prohibited in my kingdom.
IMMEDIATELY DISCARD ALL MOUNDS BARS.

Further, any nuts that are not peanuts or walnuts are banned.
Except for peanuts the cartoon. That is also banned.

Thank you for your cooperation. If you have any questions, my cell number is 206-555-1234.
